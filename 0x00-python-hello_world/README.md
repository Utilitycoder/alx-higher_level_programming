# Python - Hello World

In this project, I began practicing using the interpreter, printing text
and variables, and indexing and slicing strings in Python.

## Tasks :school:

* **0. Run Python File**
  * [0-run](./0-run): Bash script that runs a Python script file saved
  in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.

* **1. Run inline**
  * [1-run_inline](./1-run_inline): Bash script that runs Python code saved in the
  environment variable `$PYCODE`.

* **2. Hello, print**
  * [2-print.py](./2-print.py): Python script that prints exactly `"Programming is
  like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line using the function `print`.

* **3. Print integer**
  * [3-print_number.py](./3-print_number.py): Python script that prints the integer stored
  in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`, followed by a new line.
  * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/3-print_number.py).
