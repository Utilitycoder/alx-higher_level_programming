# Python - Hello World

In this project, I began practicing using the interpreter, printing text
and variables, and indexing and slicing strings in Python.

## Tasks :school:

* **0. Run Python File**
  * [0-run](./0-run): Bash script that runs a Python script file saved
  in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.
